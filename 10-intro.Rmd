# Introduction {#intro}

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a potentially serious sleep disorder. This is a common disorder characterized by repetitive episodes of nocturnal breathing cessation due to upper airway collaps. The obstructive events (apnoeas or hypopnoeas) cause a progressive asphyxia that increasingly stimulates breathing efforts against the collapsed airway. 

The aetiology of OSA is multifactorial, consisting of a complex interplay between anatomic, neuromuscular factors and an underlying genetic predisposition toward the disease. Risk factors include: snoring, male gender, middle age, menopause in women, obesity, narrowed airway, hypertension, chronic nasal congestion, smoking, diabetes, family history of sleep apnea, asthma, large neck circumference, enlarged tonsils/adenoids and low-lying soft palate.

Complications from recurrent OSA may include: daytime fatigue and sleepiness, cardiovascular problems, complications with medications and surgery, eye problems, or sleep-deprived partners. Also, people with obstructive sleep apnea may also complain of memory problems, morning headaches, mood swings or feelings of depression, and a need to urinate frequently at night (nocturia).

In this exercise the primary objective is to identify predictive factors for sleep apnea in OSA patients using multivariable logistic regression models. We aim to identify risk factors for OSA.
