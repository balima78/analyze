# Introduction {#intro}

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a potentially serious sleep disorder. This is a common disorder characterized by repetitive episodes of nocturnal breathing cessation due to upper airway collapse. The obstructive events (apneas or hypopneas) cause a progressive asphyxia that increasingly stimulates breathing efforts against the collapsed airway. 

The aetiology of OSA is multifactorial, consisting of a complex interplay between anatomic, neuromuscular factors and an underlying genetic predisposition toward the disease. Risk factors include: snoring, male gender, middle age, menopause in women, obesity, narrowed airway, hypertension, chronic nasal congestion, smoking, diabetes, family history of sleep apnea, asthma, large neck circumference, enlarged tonsils/adenoids and low-lying soft palate.

Complications from recurrent OSA may include: daytime fatigue and sleepiness, cardiovascular problems, complications with medications and surgery, eye problems, or sleep-deprived partners. Also, people with obstructive sleep apnea may also complain of memory problems, morning headaches, mood swings or feelings of depression, and a need to urinate frequently at night (nocturia).

In this exercise, our primary aim is to identify predictive factors for OSA, using multivariable logistic regression models; and identify risk factors for OSA.
