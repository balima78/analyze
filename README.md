ANALYZE from HEADS: group assignment

Using the database osa_simulated_523.csv which includes data from 523 patients who were referred to sleep consultation for risk of obstructive sleep apnea:

Present a descriptive analysis of the dataset.

Identify covariates significantly associated with the outcome “OSA”, presenting the effect of that association (e.g. OR) and the corresponding significance (e.g. p-value or 95%CI).

Build a multivariable logistic regression model, using any appropriate covariate selection method.

Evaluate the derived model, using any appropriate model evaluation strategy, presenting estimates of the generalizability of using the model as diagnostic predictor for new patients.

Comment on how different your approach and final solution would need to be if applied to the larger osa_simulated.csv dataset, discussing on the implications for traditional analysis of having “too large” datasets.
