## New Model {#results4}
From the previous model we decied to discard also PHT,  Hypertension and Nocturia. 
```{r}

new.model<-glm(formula = osa ~ Age.Cat + Conc.decrease + 
                 Gender + Genetics + CFA + VehicleCrashes + 
                 Humor + GE.Reflux + Diabetes + Driver + 
                 Hypothyroidism + Stroke + ESS.Cat + 
                 Wit.Apneas , 
               family = "binomial",
               data = osa.Selected)

tidy(new.model) %>% mutate(OR = round(exp(estimate),2)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "New Logistic regression model")%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))

```

### New model's formula
```{r}
formula(new.model) %>% pander()
```

### Summary statistics
```{r}
glance(new.model) %>% kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
```

### Hosmer-Lemeshow Test
```{r}
phl.new<-hoslem.test(osa.Selected$osa, fitted(new.model), g=10)$p.value
```
For the Goodness of fit test we obtained a p-value = `r round(phl.new,3)`. So, for a 5% significance level we do not reject the null hypothesis of Good fit.

### Pseudo R^2
```{r}
pR2(new.model) %>% kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
```

### Accuracy
```{r}
pred.new = predict(new.model, newdata=osa.Selected,type='response')

acc.new <- table(ifelse(pred.new<0.5, 0, 1), osa.Selected[,"osa"])

optCutOff<-optimalCutoff(osa.Selected$osa, pred.new)

mce<-misClassError(osa.Selected$osa, pred.new, threshold = optCutOff)

```

For a cut-off of 0.5, we have the confusion matrix (lines are predicted, columns are actuals):
```{r}
acc.new %>% kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "left")
```


Accuracy for a cut-off of 0.5: **`r round(sum(diag(acc.new))/sum(acc.new), 2)`**

When we tried to find an Optimal cut-off, we aobtained: **`r round(optCutOff,2)`**

For this optimal cut-off we have a misclassification error of: **`r round(mce,2)`**, i.e, accuracy = **`r round(1-mce,2)`**

### ROC
Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve traces the percentage of true positives accurately predicted by our logit model as the prediction probability cutoff is lowered from 1 to 0.
```{r}
plotROC(osa.Selected$osa, pred.new)
```


### VIF
```{r}
vif(new.model) %>% kable(caption = "Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) to check for multicollinearity in the new model") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
```
All the variables in the model have VIF well below 4.


### Leave one out Cross-validation
```{r}
loo<-cv.glm(osa.Selected,new.model)
```
Each time, leave-one-out cross-validation leaves out one observation, produces a fit on all the other data, and then makes a prediction at the y value for that observation that you lift out.

For the this model we obtained a cross-validated prediction error of **`r round(loo$delta[1],3)`**, i.e. an accuracy iqual to **`r round(1-loo$delta[1],3)`**.

The advantage of the leave-one-out cross-validation method is that we make use all data points reducing potential bias. However, the process is repeated as many times as there are data points, resulting to a higher execution time when n is extremely large.
